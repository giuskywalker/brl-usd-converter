# brl-usd-converter
Simple python project that i did to exercise a little bit of web scrapping.

# How it works?

It's really simple, using the requests library from python, the code will access a website that brings the quotation, so everytime the code runs, a new value should appear.

## Usage:
`python3 money.py`
